	<h1>Welcome to the Shakti Creations Official Website!</h1>
	
	<h3>We are a small group of artists and writers who wish to make multimedia works to share with the world. We mostly focus on webcomics, however we also hope to release books and games in the future.</h3>
	
	<h1>About us:</h1>
	
	<h3>Lis: I've been creating things for as long as I can remember, getting inspired at the strangest of times. I have a range of works in mind that I hope I can all work on one day. I tend to look out for everyone as well, and hope to be interactive with our fans.</h3>
	
	<h3>Adrian: Someone who's had an interest in art since a child. I can either draw for a long time in a day, or go days without drawing-but I'll always think about writing. It's one of my passions, and so is art. I also am in many fandoms, but I have to say my favorite things to see are fantasy or sci-fi or horror-any combined is also great.</h3>
	
	<h3>Tasha: A nonbinary friend who's imaginary friends became their imaginary children. I hope you enjoy watching my children grow up! Just a warning, a lot of them are inspired by the weirdest things.</h3>
	
	<h3>Kenny: Nonbinary pal with an interest in multiple fandoms and makes creations whenever motivated.</h3>
